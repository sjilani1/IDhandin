        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to practice following the iterative design process in solving a design problem. In
          this project,
          we worked with Aster, a startup that seeks to improve women’s health practices. Pregnant individuals face
          challenges in managing healthcare documentation for prenatal and postpartum care, leading to incomplete or
          delayed submissions to the provider. In this project, Aster seeks a cohesive, user-friendly digital solution
          to
          streamline this process and improve care efficiency. We collaborated with Aster to create a hi-fi prototype of
          a
          mobile app that establishes an easy-to-use interface for pregnant individuals to efficiently complete
          healthcare
          forms.

        <h2> Initial Sketches </h2>
        <p>
          An initial part of the iterative design process involved drafting up sketches for potential designs. Each one
          of us individually
          brainstormed two distinctly different flows for the mobile app. We had a variety of ideas!

    <h2> Our Design </h2>
    <p>We went through many different iterations of our design for Aster Health. Considering the emphasis on innovative design for form completion and collecting information, most of our sketches are experimental ways of thinking about playful design. </p>
    <p class="question">
      What design decisions led us to our final design?
    </p>
    <p>As you can see in some of our sketches, our first iteration of designs often focus on adding functionality or flair to a simple integrated form completion process. After encouragement from Talie, we also thought about more "crazy" ways to achieve our goals, including integrating games surrounding form completion and bringing in a factor of competition and urgency. We also explored the route of making a mascot for the app, the idea being that an animal mascot might endear the user and make them feel more comfortable.  </p>
    <p class="question">
      What parts did we keep from different sketches and why?
    </p>
    <p>After feedback from our partners at Aster Health, it became clear that users going through a pregnancy, both an emotional and difficult time, would prioritize efficient and clear design over playful engagement features. We therefore decided to keep only the most sober and efficient features we had sketched, such as the modular presentation of our forms, including a process bar and indications of how many minutes are left. We also kept the feature of notifications that enable our users to answer directly in the notifications tab, similar to a WhatsApp notifications (with a press and hold, type answer in notification feature). Another feature we kept were the possibility to put in information through voice notes and uploading forms. Both of these option should make form submission and information collection more accessible our users and save time and energy. Finally, some of the chat components from our initial sketches were considered when our collaborators suggested incorporating a conversational way of filling the forms. We got very positive feedback for those features from both peers and Aster, which is why they are included. </p>
    <p class="question">
      How our designs lead to the intended impact
    </p>
    <p>Our design leads to the intended impact because we prioritized features that communicate transparency, encouragement and efficiency. </p>

    <h2> Takeaways </h2>
    <p>
      Our client, Aster, highlighted several positive features and key takeaways from our final prototype. Fifi, the
      founder, expressed her appreciation for our swift adjustment following her initial feedback.

    </p>
    <h2> Features they will implement </h2>
    <p>
      <li> Aster Assitant: we integrated a chatbot named Aster Assistant, which allows users to interact via chat,
        calls, or voice messages to complete forms. Fifi remarked that we effectively made Aster feel like a "warm
        entity" and succeeded in humanizing the company </li>
      <li> Time-Left Feature: aims to display how much time a user has remaining, helping to alleviate feelings of
        overwhelm by showing limits on task duration. This had not been previously considered by the company!</li>
      <li> Scan Feature: scan feature targets both patients and healthcare providers, enabling them to scan existing
        forms and avoid redundant tasks.This had not been considered previously. </li>
      <li>Lock screen question completion </li>
      <li> Simple and straightforward design </li>
      <li> Accessible color palette </li>

    <h2> Things to improve </h2>
    <p>

      <li> The affirmations page, though in good faith, may be patrionising and waste user’s time.</li>
      <li> Restructuring the information architecture on the checklist page in order to prevent a user being overwhelmed
      </li>
      <li> Adding shared features for instance a shared signature or shared information across forms
      </li>
    </p>

    <h2> What did we learn? </h2>

    <p>This was our team’s first attempt at prototyping and thus our final deliverable was not up to par. We would like
      to improve our autolayering and information architecture to modify our design from medium-level fidelity to high
      fidelity.
      We also recognised that design features should be out of the box! While we were hesitant to add the gamification
      feature initially we are glad we did because it helped us pivot to other unique ideas such as timers and scanning.
      We recognise not all unique features will be well-recieved but we were encouraged to think broad!
